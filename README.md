# Cecil Infinite Session
Gets rid of the annoying pop-up to renew your Cecil session (University of Auckland)

Requires greasemonkey/tampermonkey (or equivalent system for running JS userscripts).

# Installing
The easiest way is:
  1. Copy the whole JS file to your clipboard
  1. Create a new userscript
  1. Click "Use Script from Clipboard" (at least that's what it's called in Greasemonkey)
or paste the script in the text editor that appears for script editing
  1. Done
